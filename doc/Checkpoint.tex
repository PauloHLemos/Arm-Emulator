\section{Group Organisation}

We first held a preliminary series of online meetings where we examined the specification thoroughly and decided internal deadlines for each part of the emulator. A spreadsheet was created for a clear, visual representation of timescales and to track the progress of each section. After setting some programming standards and the general skeleton  of the emulator  as a group, we split into pairs to work on the loader + fetch (Weizhong, Paulo) and the decode + execute functions (Otto, Rob). The next stage was creating the individual ARM instructions (Data Processing, Multiply, Single Data Transfer and Branch) which we assigned to Otto, Rob, Paulo and Weizhong respectively. Once these were completed, our group came together in person to more efficiently integrate our work and merge our separate branches. Initially, we had some difficulty coordinating meetings due to location and schedule but this was non-disruptive as we each had our specific tasks to complete. Our group generally distributed work by parts which seemed fair but we quickly realised that some parts were quite a bit longer than others. For the assembler, our aim is to divide the work more equally.
